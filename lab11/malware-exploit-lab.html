You have been asked to demonstrate your ability to pinpoint the details of an attack in which a computer was compromised. Your goal is to answer a series of questions using Sguil, Kibana, and Wireshark in Security Onion.</p>
                <p>You have been given the following details about the event:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The event happened in January of 2017.</li>
                    <li>It was discovered by the Snort NIDS.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>

                <h3>Part 1: Use Kibana to Learn About a Malware Exploit</h3>
                <p>In Part 1, use Kibana to answer the following questions. To help you get started, you are informed that the attack took place at some time during January 2017. You will need to pinpoint the exact time.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Narrow the timeframe.</h4>
                <p>a. Login to Security Onion with the analyst username and cyberops password.</p>
                <p>b. Open Kibana (username analyst and password cyberops) and set an Absolute time range to narrow the focus to log data from January 2017.</p>
                <p>c. You will see a graph appear with a single entry showing. To view more details, you need to narrow the amount of time that is displayed. Narrow the time range in the Total Log Count Over Time visualization by clicking and dragging to select an area around the graph data point. You may need to repeat this process until you see some detail in the graph.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>Note: Use the &lt;Esc&gt; key to close any dialog boxes that may be interfering with your work.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Locate the Event in Kibana</h4>
                <p>a. After narrowing the time range in the main Kibana dashboard, go to the NIDS Alert Data dashboard by clicking NIDS.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>b. Zoom in on the event by clicking and dragging in the NIDS â€“ Alerts Over Time visualization further focus in on the event timeframe. Since the event happened over a very short period of time, select just the graph plot line. Zoom in until your display resembles the one below.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>c. Click the first point on the timeline to filter for only that first event.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>d. Now view details for the events that occurred at that time. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the dashboard until you see the NIDS Alerts section of the page. The alerts are arranged by time. Expand the first event in the list by clicking the pointer arrow that is to the left of the timestamp.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>e. Look at the expanded alert details and answer the following questions:</p>

                <p class="question">What is the time of the first detected NIDS alert in Kibana?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the source IP address in the alert?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the destination IP address in the alert?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the destination port in the alert? What service is this?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the classification of the alert?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the destination geo country name?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <h4>Step 3: View the Transcript capME!</h4>
                <p>a. Click the alert _id value, you can pivot to CapME to inspect the transcript of the event.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>In the CapME! window you can see the transcript from the session. It shows the transactions between the source computer, in blue, and the destinations that are accessed by the source. A lot of valuable information, including a link to the pcap file that is related to this alert, is available in the transcript.</p>

                <p>Examine the first block of blue text. This is the request from the source to the destination webserver. Note that two URLs are listed in this block. The first is tagged as SRC: REFERER. This is the website that the source computer first accessed. However, the server referred browser the HTTP GET request to the SRC:HOST. Something in the HTML sent the source to this site. It looks like this could be a drive-by attack!</p>

                <p class="question">What website did the user intend to connect to?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What URL did the browser refer the user to?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What kind of content is requested by the source host from tybenme.com? Why could this be a problem? Look in the DST server block of the transcript too.</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p>b. Close the CapME! browser tab.</p>
                <p>c. From the top of the NIDS Alert Dashboard click the HTTP entry located under Zeek Hunting heading.</p>
                <p>d. In the HTTP dashboard, verify that your absolute time range includes 2017-01-27 22:54:30.000 to 2017-01-27 22:56:00.000.</p>
                <p>e. Scroll down to the HTTP - Sites section of the dashboard.</p>

                <p class="question">What are some of the websites that are listed?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p>We should know some of these websites from the transcript that we read earlier. Not all of the sites that are shown are part of the exploit campaign. Research the URLs by searching for them on the internet. Do not connect to them. Place the URLs in quotes when you do your searches.</p>

                <p class="question">Which of these sites is likely part of the exploit campaign?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What are the HTTP - MIME Types listed in the Tag Cloud?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

            <section>
                <h3>Part 2: Investigate the Exploit with Sguil</h3>
                <p>In Part 2, you will use Sguil to check the IDS alerts and gather more information about the series of events related to this attack.</p>
                <p>Note: The alert IDs used in this lab are for example only. The alert IDs on your VM may be different.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Open Sguil and locate the alerts.</h4>
                <p>a. Launch Sguil from the desktop. Login with username analyst and password cyberops. Enable all sensors and click Start.</p>
                <p>b. Locate the group of alerts from January 27th 2017.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p class="question">According to Sguil, what are the timestamps for the first and last of the alerts that occurred within about a second of each other?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <h4>Step 2: Investigate the alerts in Sguil.</h4>
                <p>a. Click the Show Packet Data and Show Rule checkboxes to see the packet header field information and the IDS signature rule related to the alert.</p>
                <p>b. Select the alert ID 5.2 (Event message ET CURRENT Evil Redirector Leading to EK Jul 12 2016).</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p class="question">According to the IDS signature rule which malware family triggered this alert? You may need to scroll through the alert signature to find this entry.</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p>c. Maximize the Sguil window and size the Event Message column so that you can see the text of the entire message. Look at the Event Messages for each of the alert IDs related to this attack.</p>

                <p class="question">According to the Event Messages in Sguil what exploit kit (EK) is involved in this attack?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">By your best estimate looking at the alerts so far, what is the basic vector of this attack? How did the attack take place?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <h4>Step 3: View Transcripts of Events</h4>
                <p>a. Right-click the associated alert ID 5.2 (Event Message ET CURRENT_EVENTS Evil Redirector Leading to EK Jul 12 2016). Select Transcript from the menu as shown in the figure.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p class="question">What are the referer and host websites that are involved in the first SRC event? What do you think the user did to generate this alert?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p>b. Right-click the alert ID 5.24 (source IP address of 139.59.160.143 and Event Message ET CURRENT_EVENTS Evil Redirector Leading to EK March 15 2017) and choose Transcript to open a transcript of the conversation.</p>

                <h3>Part 3: Use Wireshark to Investigate an Attack</h3>
                <p>In Part 3, you will pivot to Wireshark to closely examine the details of the attack.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Pivot to Wireshark and Change Settings.</h4>
                <p>a. In Sguil, right-click the alert ID 5.2 (Event Message ET CURRENT_EVENTS Evil Redirector Leading to EK Jul 12 2016) and pivot to select Wireshark from the menu. The pcap that is associated with this alert will open in Wireshark.</p>
                <p>b. The default Wireshark setting uses a relative time per-packet which is not very helpful for isolating the exact time an event occurred. To fix this, select to View > Time Display Format > Date and Time of Day and then repeat a second time, View > Time Display Format > Seconds. Now your Wireshark Time column has the date and timestamps. Resize the columns to make the display clearer if necessary.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <h4>Step 2: Investigate HTTP Traffic.</h4>
                <p>a. In Wireshark, use the http.request display filter to filter for web requests only.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>b. Select the first packet. In the packet details area, expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol application layer data.</p>

                <p class="question">What website directed the user to the www.homeimprovement.com website?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <h4>Step 3: View HTTP Objects.</h4>
                <p>a. In Wireshark, choose File > Export Objects > HTTP.</p>
                <p>b. In the Export HTTP objects list window, select the remodeling-your-kitchen-cabinets.html packet and save it to your home folder.</p>
                <p>c. Close Wireshark. In Sguil, right-click the alert ID 5.24 (source IP address 139.59.160.143 and Event Message ET CURRRENT_EVENTS Evil Redirector Leading to EK March 15 2017) and choose Wireshark to pivot to Wireshark. Apply an http.request display filter and answer the following questions:</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the http request for?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p class="question">What is the host server?</p>
                <div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div>

                <p>d. In Wireshark, go to File > Export Objects > HTTP and save the JavaScript file to your home folder.</p>
                <p>e. Close Wireshark. In Sguil, right-click the alert ID 5.25 (Event Message ET CURRENT_EVENTS RIG EK URI Struct Mar 13 2017 M2) and choose Wireshark to pivot to Wireshark. Apply an http.request display filter. Notice that this alert corresponds to the three GET, POST, and GET requests that we looked at earlier.</p>
                <p>f. With the first packet selected, in the packet details area, expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol application layer data. Right-click the Host information and choose Apply as Column to add the Host information to the packet list columns, as shown in the figure.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>g. To make room for the Host column right-click the Length column header and uncheck it. This will remove the Length column from the display.</p>
                <p>h. The names of the servers are now clearly visible in the Host column of the packet list.</p>

                <h4>Step 4: Create a Hash for an Exported Malware File.</h4>
                <p>We know that the user intended to access www.homeimprovement.com, but the site referred the user to other sites. Eventually files were downloaded to the host from a malware site. In this part of the lab, we will access the files that were downloaded and submit a file hash to VirusTotal to verify that a malicious file was downloaded.</p>
                <p>a. In Wireshark, go to File > Export Objects > HTTP and save the two text/html files and the application/x-shockwave-flash file to your home directory.</p>

                <div class="screenshot-container"></div>

                <p>b. Now that you have saved the three files to your home folder, test to see if one of the files matches a known hash value for malware at virustotal.com. Issue a ls -l command to look at the files saved in your home directory. The flash file has the word SeaMonkey near the beginning of the long filename. The filename begins with %3fbiw=SeaMonkey. Use the ls -l command with grep to filter out the filename with the pattern seamonkey. The option -i ignores the case distinction.</p>
                <pre>analyst@SecOnion:~$ ls -l | grep -i seamonkey
-rw-r--r-- 1 analyst analyst 16261 Jun 9 05:50
%3fbiw=SeaMonkey.105qj67.406x7d8b3&yus=SeaMonkey.78vg115.406g6d1r6&br_fl=2957&oq=pLLYG

                <p>c. Generate a SHA-1 hash for the SeaMonkey flash file with the command sha1sum followed by the filename. Type the first 4 letters %3fb of the filename and then press the tab key to auto fill the rest of the filename. Press enter and sha1sum will compute a 40 digit long fixed length hash value.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Exploit Kits are fairly complex exploits that use a variety of methods
                and resources to carry out an attack. Interestingly EKs may be used to
                deliver diverse malware payloads. This is because the EK developer may
                offer the exploit kit as a service to other threat actors. Therefore,
                RIG EK has been associated with a number of different malware payloads.
                The following questions may require you investigate the data further
                using the tools that were introduced in this lab.</p>

                <p>1. The EK used a number of websites. Complete the table below.</p>

                <table class="report-info">
                    <tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>www.bing.com</td>
                        <td>N/A</td>
                        <td>search engine links to legitimate webpage</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td><div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div></td>
                        <td><div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><div class="text-answer" contenteditable="true"></div></td>

                </table>

                <p>2. It is useful to "tell the story" of an exploit to understand what
                happened and how it works. Start with the user searching the
                internet with Bing. Search the web for more information on the RIG
                EK to help.</p>
